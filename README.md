# LatentDirichletAllocation-Genism

LDA stands for Latent Dirichlet Allocation. LDA is a Bayesian version of pLSA. In particular, it uses dirichlet priors for the document-topic and word-topic distributions, lending itself to better generalization.
From a dirichlet distribution Dir(Œ±), we draw a random sample representing the topic distribution, or topic mixture, of a particular document. This topic distribution is Œ∏. From Œ∏, we select a particular topic Z based on the distribution.
Next, from another dirichlet distribution Dir(ùõΩ), we select a random sample representing the word distribution of the topic Z. This word distribution is œÜ. From œÜ, we choose the word w.
